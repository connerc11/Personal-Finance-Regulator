# Budget Data Isolation Fix

## Problem
New users were seeing preset budget data from demo/sample accounts instead of starting with a clean slate.

## Root Cause
The analytics API and budget API were falling back to global mock data when backend services were unavailable, causing all users to see the same preset budget and transaction data.

## Solution
Modified the API services to be user-aware:

### Changes Made

1. **Analytics API (`frontend/src/services/apiService.ts`)**
   - Added user detection logic to differentiate between demo users and new users
   - Demo user (ID: 1, email: demo@personalfinance.com) continues to see sample data
   - New users now receive empty data instead of mock data
   - Applied to:
     - `getDashboardData()` - Returns empty financial summary for new users
     - `getMonthlyTrend()` - Returns empty trend data for new users  
     - `getCategoryBreakdown()` - Returns empty category data for new users
     - `getBudgetPerformance()` - Returns empty budget performance for new users

2. **Budget API (`frontend/src/services/apiService.ts`)**
   - Added fallback logic for when backend budget service (port 8083) is unavailable
   - Demo user gets sample budgets
   - New users get empty budget list with helpful message

3. **Transaction API (`frontend/src/services/apiService.ts`)**
   - Added user-aware fallback for transaction data
   - Demo user gets sample transactions
   - New users start with empty transaction history

4. **Axios Import Fix**
   - Fixed axios import issue by adding proper type imports
   - Created dedicated service clients for budget service (port 8083) and analytics service (port 8082)
   - Replaced raw axios calls with properly configured service clients

### User Experience
- **Demo User**: Continues to see sample data for demonstration purposes
- **New Users**: Start with clean slates and helpful messages encouraging them to add their first transactions/budgets
- **Existing Users**: Unaffected - their real data from backend services continues to work

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/services/apiService.ts` - Main API service with user-aware fallbacks and axios client configuration
- `BUDGET_DATA_FIX.md` - This documentation file

### Testing
1. Create a new user account
2. Verify that budget pages show "No budgets yet" instead of preset data
3. Verify that analytics/reports show empty states instead of sample data
4. Verify that demo user still sees sample data
5. Verify that frontend compiles without axios import errors

## Technical Details

### Demo User Detection
```typescript
const isDemoUser = (userId: number, userEmail?: string): boolean => {
  return userId === 1 || userEmail === 'demo@personalfinance.com';
};
```

### Service Clients
- `budgetServiceClient` - For budget service API (port 8083)
- `analyticsServiceClient` - For analytics service API (port 8082)
- `apiClient` - For main API gateway (port 8080)

## Future Improvements
- Ensure backend services are running to avoid fallback scenarios
- Consider user-specific localStorage keys for additional isolation
- Add proper backend JWT validation to prevent data leakage
- Implement proper error handling for service unavailability
