### 2. Start Services
Run the startup script:
```powershell
.\start-save-spotlight.ps1
```

This will start:
- User Service (port 8081)
- API Gateway (port 8080)  
- Frontend (port 3000)

### 3. Access the Feature
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Click on "Save Spotlight" in the navigation
4. Explore the three tabs: Shared Goals, Community Chat, Share a Goal

## What Changed from Demo Data

### Before (Demo Data)
- Hardcoded sample goals and messages
- No real persistence
- Simulated API responses
- No user authentication integration

### After (Database Integration)
- Real database persistence with PostgreSQL
- Full CRUD operations for all entities
- JWT authentication for all endpoints
- Proper user association for all content
- Real-time data updates
- Scalable architecture for production use

## Security Features
- JWT token validation on all endpoints
- User ownership validation for edit/delete operations
- SQL injection prevention through JPA
- XSS protection through proper data sanitization

## Next Steps for Enhancement
1. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live chat
2. **Notifications**: Email/push notifications for goal milestones
3. **Advanced Search**: Filter goals by category, progress, etc.
4. **Goal Categories**: Predefined categories for better organization
5. **Achievement System**: Badges for reaching milestones
6. **File Uploads**: Allow images for goal sharing
7. **Admin Panel**: Moderation tools for chat rooms and content

The Save Spotlight feature is now fully functional with proper database integration and ready for production use!
